Our current food system has a serious impact on the environment and breeding is identified as one of the main causes of the climate crisis: for this reason, alternatives to animal proteins are being promoted.

The plant-based choice is linked both to ethical and health reasons but also to the reduced environmental impact that this entails and to its potential to mitigate emissions, which are fundamental in the context of the climate crisis we are facing: according to the IPCC, the mitigation potential of vegan diet is the highest compared to all other diets, the Mediterranean one is in last place.
