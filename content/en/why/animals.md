We are not here as animal spokes people because animals have a voice and constantly rebel in farms, slaughterhouses, fishing nets, they attach themselves with all their strength to life, because they are sentient beings and experience the same suffering as us. Many of the people who are reading this have probably never met the gaze of a cow taken to slaughter, but if you had you would see such a strong attachment to life, animals that poke the bars, screaming, showing signs of stress, cannibalism, apathy, and stereotyped behaviors that indicate severe stress. And it is not just a question of empathy, but of justice. We live in an age where we always begin to notice more than inequalities and the need for rights, in a state that should undertake to guarantee fundamental rights to human beings and also promises them to animals, as enshrined in our constitution. So why do we find it so absurd to think that an animal's life matters? Why do we mock those who are not ashamed to say it and fight for their rights? After all, we human beings are also part of the animal kingdom, one thing that unites all of us is the criterion of sentience, therefore everyone should have the right to life.
